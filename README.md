If I make a pull request for CDDA that gets rejected it will probably end up here as a mod.

   Current mods are:

   - Unlisted Firearms - an assortment of guns and their accessories that don't meet the 100 listings on whatever gun website criteria. Currently only 3 guns but I intent to add more as time permits.
   - Not done anything else yet

   Disclaimer: I am not a programmer, I'm barely computer literate so if there are any issues explain them to me like I'm 5 years old and be patient.
